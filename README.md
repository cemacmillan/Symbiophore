# Symbiophore Mod for RimWorld

Welcome to the jungle! A world where grubs aren't just critters burrowing in your garden; they're your best friend, your psychic sponge, and maybe the most intelligent thing in your colony!

## What's a Symbiophore?

Hailing from the lush jungles, the Symbiophore is an half-meter long grub with strange psychic properties. Despite its resemblance to a subterranean larva, these critters have an uncanny knack for forming emotional bonds with humans, making them a squirming attraction in any colony.

## Features:

- **Psychic Buffet**: Symbiophores love psychic entropy like you wouldn't believe. They absorb it so you don't have to. Nice, right?
- **Mood Ring**: Got a case of the Mondays? Symbiophores provide emotional comfort, keeping those mood debuffs at bay.
- **Intelligence? Check**: Despite the grub-like exterior, they're smarter than they look. And probably smarter than some of your colonists, too.

So there you have it. The Symbiophore mod: because who knew you needed a psychic grub until you had one? Get ready to embrace the squirm. 

Onwards and modwards!
