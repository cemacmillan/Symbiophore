# Symbiophore Mod for RimWorld

Welcome to the jungle! A world where grubs aren't just critters burrowing in your garden; they're your best friend, your psychic sponge, and probably the most intelligent thing in your colony!

## What's a Symbiophore?

Hailing from the lush jungles, the Symbiophore is an alien grub that just can't stop meddling with psychic phenomena. Despite its resemblance to a subterranean oddball, these critters have an uncanny knack for forming emotional bonds with humans, making them the star (albeit squirming) attraction in any colony.

## Features:

Psychic Buffet: Symbiophores love psychic entropy like you wouldn't believe. They absorb it so you don't have to. Nice, right?
Mood Ring: Got a case of the Mondays? Symbiophores provide emotional comfort, keeping those mood debuffs at bay.
Intelligence? Check: Despite the grub-like exterior, they're smarter than they look. And probably smarter than some of your colonists, too.
So there you have it. The Symbiophore mod: because who knew you needed a psychic grub until you had one? Get ready to embrace the squirm.

Onwards and modwards!
